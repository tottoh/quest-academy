            <h1>Python</h1>
            <p>Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language. Its design philosophy emphasizes code
                readability with the use of significant indentation.[33]

                Python is dynamically typed and garbage-collected. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including
                structured (particularly procedural), object-oriented and functional programming. It is often described
                as a "batteries included" language due to its comprehensive standard library.[34][35]

                Guido van Rossum began working on Python in the late 1980s as a successor to the ABC programming
                language and first released it in 1991 as Python 0.9.0.[36] Python 2.0 was released in 2000. Python 3.0,
                released in 2008, was a major revision not completely backward-compatible with earlier versions. Python
                2.7.18, released in 2020, was the last release of Python 2.[37]

                Python consistently ranks as one of the most popular programming languages, and has gained widespread
                use in the machine learning community.[38][39][40][41]</p>

            <h1>Java</h1>
            <p>Java is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language that is designed to have as few
                implementation dependencies as possible. It is a general-purpose programming language intended to let
                programmers write once, run anywhere (WORA),[16] meaning that compiled Java code can run on all
                platforms that support Java without the need to recompile.[17] Java applications are typically compiled
                to bytecode that can run on any Java virtual machine (JVM) regardless of the underlying computer
                architecture. Although its syntax is similar to that of C and C++, the Java language has fewer low-level
                facilities than either of them. The Java runtime provides dynamic capabilities (such as reflection and
                runtime code modification) that are typically not available in traditional compiled languages.

                Java gained popularity shortly after its release, and has been a very popular programming language since
                then.[18] Java was the third most popular programming language in 2022 according to GitHub.[19] Although
                still widely popular, there has been a gradual decline in use of Java in recent years with other
                languages using JVM gaining popularity.[20]

                Java was originally developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems. It was released in May 1995 as a
                core component of Sun's Java platform. The original and reference implementation Java compilers, virtual
                machines, and class libraries were originally released by Sun under proprietary licenses. As of May
                2007, in compliance with the specifications of the Java Community Process, Sun had relicensed most of
                its Java technologies under the GPL-2.0-only license. Oracle offers its own HotSpot Java Virtual
                Machine, however the official reference implementation is the OpenJDK JVM which is free open-source
                software and used by most developers and is the default JVM for almost all Linux distributions.

                As of March 2024, Java 22 is the latest version. Java 8, 11, 17, and 21 are previous LTS versions still
                officially supported</p>

            <h1>Javascript</h1>
            <p>JavaScript (/ˈdʒɑːvəskrɪpt/), often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language and core technology of
                the Web, alongside HTML and CSS. 99% of websites use JavaScript on the client side for webpage
                behavior.[10]

                Web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine that executes the client code. These engines are also
                utilized in some servers and a variety of apps. The most popular runtime system for non-browser usage is
                Node.js.

                JavaScript is a high-level, often just-in-time compiled language that conforms to the ECMAScript
                standard.[11] It has dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions. It
                is multi-paradigm, supporting event-driven, functional, and imperative programming styles. It has
                application programming interfaces (APIs) for working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard
                data structures, and the Document Object Model (DOM).

                The ECMAScript standard does not include any input/output (I/O), such as networking, storage, or
                graphics facilities. In practice, the web browser or other runtime system provides JavaScript APIs for
                I/O.

                Although Java and JavaScript are similar in name, syntax, and respective standard libraries, the two
                languages are distinct and differ greatly in design.</p>

            <h1>C++</h1>
            <p>C++ (/ˈsiː plʌs plʌs/, pronounced "C plus plus" and sometimes abbreviated as CPP) is a high-level,
                general-purpose programming language created by Danish computer scientist Bjarne Stroustrup. First
                released in 1985 as an extension of the C programming language, it has since expanded significantly over
                time; as of 1997, C++ has object-oriented, generic, and functional features, in addition to facilities
                for low-level memory manipulation for systems like microcomputers or to make operating systems like
                Linux or Windows. It is usually implemented as a compiled language, and many vendors provide C++
                compilers, including the Free Software Foundation, LLVM, Microsoft, Intel, Embarcadero, Oracle, and
                IBM.[14]

                C++ was designed with systems programming and embedded, resource-constrained software and large systems
                in mind, with performance, efficiency, and flexibility of use as its design highlights.[15] C++ has also
                been found useful in many other contexts, with key strengths being software infrastructure and
                resource-constrained applications,[15] including desktop applications, video games, servers (e.g.,
                e-commerce, web search, or databases), and performance-critical applications (e.g., telephone switches
                or space probes).[16]

                C++ is standardized by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), with the latest
                standard version ratified and published by ISO in December 2020 as ISO/IEC 14882:2020 (informally known
                as C++20).[17] The C++ programming language was initially standardized in 1998 as ISO/IEC 14882:1998,
                which was then amended by the C++03, C++11, C++14, and C++17 standards. The current C++20 standard
                supersedes these with new features and an enlarged standard library. Before the initial standardization
                in 1998, C++ was developed by Stroustrup at Bell Labs since 1979 as an extension of the C language; he
                wanted an efficient and flexible language similar to C that also provided high-level features for
                program organization.[18] Since 2012, C++ has been on a three-year release schedule[19] with C++23 as
                the next planned standard.[20]</p>

            <h1>Swift</h1>
            <p>Swift is a high-level general-purpose, multi-paradigm, compiled programming language created by Chris
                Lattner in 2010 for Apple Inc. and maintained by the open-source community. Swift compiles to machine
                code, as it is an LLVM-based compiler. Swift was first released in June 2014,[11] and the Swift
                toolchain has shipped in Xcode since version 6, released in 2014.

                Apple intended Swift to support many core concepts associated with Objective-C, notably dynamic
                dispatch, widespread late binding, extensible programming, and similar features, but in a "safer" way,
                making it easier to catch software bugs; Swift has features addressing some common programming errors
                like null pointer dereferencing and provides syntactic sugar to help avoid the pyramid of doom. Swift
                supports the concept of protocol extensibility, an extensibility system that can be applied to types,
                structs and classes, which Apple promotes as a real change in programming paradigms they term
                "protocol-oriented programming"[12] (similar to traits and type classes).[13]

                Swift was introduced at Apple's 2014 Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC).[14] It underwent an upgrade
                to version 1.2 during 2014 and a major upgrade to Swift 2 at WWDC 2015. It was initially a proprietary
                language, but version 2.2 was made open-source software under the Apache License 2.0 on December 3,
                2015, for Apple's platforms and Linux.[15][16]

                Through version 3.0 the syntax of Swift went through significant evolution, with the core team making
                source stability a focus in later versions.[17][18] In the first quarter of 2018 Swift surpassed
                Objective-C in measured popularity.[19]

                Swift 4.0, released in 2017, introduced several changes to some built-in classes and structures. Code
                written with previous versions of Swift can be updated using the migration functionality built into
                Xcode. Swift 5, released in March 2019, introduced a stable binary interface on Apple platforms,
                allowing the Swift runtime to be incorporated into Apple operating systems. It is source compatible with
                Swift 4.[20]

                Swift 5.1 was officially released in September 2019. Swift 5.1 builds on the previous version of Swift 5
                by extending the stable features of the language to compile-time with the introduction of module
                stability. The introduction of module stability makes it possible to create and share binary frameworks
                that will work with future releases of Swift.[21]

                Swift 5.5, officially announced by Apple at the 2021 WWDC, significantly expands language support for
                concurrency and asynchronous code, notably introducing a unique version of the actor model.[22]

                Swift 5.9, was released in September 2023 and includes a macro system, generic parameter packs, and
                ownership features like the new consume operator.[23]

                The current version, Swift 5.10, was released in March 2024. This version improves the language's
                concurrency model, allowing for full data isolation to prevent data races. It is also the last release
                before Swift 6.[24] Version 5.10 is currently available for macOS, Windows and, in experimental use, for
                Linux.[25]</p>
